# Goombabump, Rocketjump's companion application

Serves Etherpad Lite notepads to rocketjump. Also serves up statistics for lectures.
Goombabump is a Heroku port of my previous CloudFoundry port of EtherpadLite (Goombastomp). Long story short, deploying is hard.

# Etherpad Lite on Heroku

Forked from https://github.com/Pita/etherpad-lite and tweaked to run on Heroku's Cedar stack.
